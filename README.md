# Overview

A lot of people don’t have time to read or watch the news. Yet, we'd still like to stay in touch with what’s going on in the world. Maybe there’s a new topic you want to learn more about. Maybe you want to get updates on professional tennis matches. No matter what it is, this product will help you do just that - with one text per day.

Snipp will text you a concise, easy-to-read summary (aka a Snippet) of the trending news related to your topic of choice.
